# Modeling the spatial distribution of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in the Black Sea (BS) using deep learning
Black Sea (BS) is an important ecosystem, which is affected by various anthropogenic pressures, such as shipping activities, wastewater inputs from large coastal cities and most importantly loads by major rivers (e.g., Danube, Dniester, Dnieper). 

This project focuses on the northwestern part of the Black Sea (the Ukrainian shelf) and investigates the river sources of chemicals in the shelf. To achieve this objective, data generated by the Joint Black Sea Surveys (JBSS) were used. JBSS took place in 2016 and 2017 in context of the EU/UNDP EMBLAS II project (www.emblasproject.org). During JBSS campaigns, seawater samples were collected, extracted and analyzed by high-throughput analytical methods, namely liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). 

LC-HRMS data was processed using open-source algorithms to generate a dataset with the detected chemical signals and their intensity in the sampling stations. The dataset was used to generate images, representing the spatial distribution of the signals. The figures are used as input to a deep learning classification model. 

This project provides an end-to-end solution for the automatic estimation of the pollution potential of the major contributing rivers (Dnieper and Danube) in the Black Sea.

The datasets and the predicted spatial distribution are visualized in an interactive dash application, which is available at https://cecinbs.herokuapp.com/
